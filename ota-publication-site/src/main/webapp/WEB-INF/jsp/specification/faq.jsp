	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions about OpenTravel Specifications</h1>
	<h5>What&#8217;s the best way to get started with the
		specification?</h5>
	<p>OpenTravel publishes specifications twice a year, and the
		specification naming convention is:</p>
	<p>Year + Alpha</p>
	<p>So the first specification published in 2006 was 2006A and the
		second was 2006B.&nbsp; Download the most recent specification, and
		start with the ReadMe file and the Message Users Guide, which contains
		use cases and instance documents for most of the messages in the
		OpenTravel library.&nbsp; Match the message description with the
		business problem to be solved and review that message.</p>
	<h5>Why is the specification so flexible?</h5>
	<p>Often users of the specification say they would like the
		specification to be more rigid and contain more implementation
		guidance.&nbsp; That rigidity would not reflect the flexible way
		travel suppliers and distributors meet customer demands in
		today&#8217;s travel marketplace.&nbsp; Every set of travel trading
		partners has different messaging requirements, so OpenTravel
		specifications are designed to allow trading partners to implement the
		messages in the way that best suits their business requirements.</p>
	<h5>Why aren't there any required fields?</h5>
	<p>Each company implementing a message has different
		requirements.&nbsp; Making fields required forces specific data to be
		sent. When that data is not required by a company, that company is
		forced to send either blank or irrelevant data. OpenTravel believes it
		is a more effective to have optional fields than to force trading
		partners to exchange data that is not needed.</p>
	<h5>How can I find out more about how the specifications are
		built?</h5>
	<p>
		The <a
			href="/Resources/Uploads/PDF/OTA_SchemaDesignBestPracticesV3.06.pdf">OpenTravel
			Best Practices Guidelines</a> defines guidelines for all of OpenTravel's
		XML data assets. Specifications released prior to version base 2001C
		may not follow the guidelines defined in this document. This document
		may be updated on a regular basis.
	</p>
	<h5>How can I get answers to questions about the messages or
		implementing the messages as an OpenTravel Member?</h5>
	<p>All message level schema files are "owned" by a work group
		(Transport, Hospitality, Architecture and Travel Integration). The
		work group that owns the message is the first place to get your
		question resolved (see below - "How do I know which work group a
		message belongs to?").</p>
	<p>
		As a member of OpenTravel, you have access to the workgroup and
		project team mailing lists. Sending a detailed message to the
		appropriate mailing list is the first way to get an immediate
		discussion started.&nbsp; To be added to a mailing list, contact the <a
			href="/Contact/Default.aspx">specification manager.</a><br />
	</p>
	<p>If your question is not addressed quickly or satisfactorily, you
		may contact the specification manager (non-member requests will be
		directed to the CEO).</p>
	<p>Being able to discuss your issue within a work group may help
		you determine whether the schema does meet your requirements or
		confirm that the schema requires an update. If the schema requires an
		update, discuss with the group possible solutions to satisfy the
		requirements.</p>
	<h5>How do I know which work group a message belongs to?</h5>
	<p>Most message file names begin with a pattern. The pattern
		includes Air, Hotel, or Veh (Vehicle). If a name does not include one
		of those prefixes, the message is managed by the Travel Integration
		Work Group or Data Content/Best Practices.</p>
	<h5>How can I get answers to questions about the messages or
		implementing the messages if I am not an OpenTravel Member?</h5>
	<p>
		Members and non-members can use the <a
			href="http://www.opentravelcommunityforum.com/forum/">OpenTravel
			Implementers Forum</a>, which is moderated by OpenTravel specification
		experts and used by developers as a discussion board for schema and
		implementation questions.
	</p>
	<h5>How do I submit comments for changes to the schema?</h5>
	<p>
		Formal comments must be made using the <a
			href="/Specifications/CommentOnSpec.aspx">comments input form</a> and
		are officially accepted during comment review periods. If comments
		have been previously discussed with the work group or the Data
		Content/Best Practices (DC/BP) sub-committee, there is a better chance
		that they will be resolved exactly as submitted.
	</p>
	<h5>How do I get a new code added to the to the OpenTravel code
		list?</h5>
	<p>Code list additions should first be submitted to the work group
		via the appropriate mailing list. Once the work group has reviewed and
		approved the change, the request will be sent by either the chair of
		the work group or by the specification manager or chair of DC/BP for
		inclusion in the OpenTravel code list.</p>
